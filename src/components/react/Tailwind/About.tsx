            I began my journey in 2019 at a SaaS company, AmazeOwl, as a Growth Marketer. This role marked my initiation
            into the realms of digital marketing and remote work.

            Fast forward to now, I wield my dual expertise in marketing and coding to craft tailored solutions for small
            and medium businesses. For instance, in one project, we slashed the customer bill 10x by transitioning from
            one marketing automation software to another.

            One of my initial technical projects was a Slack Bot for Email Deliverability Audits. This bot provided
            email deliverability audits for potential agency clients by swiftly checking SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records.
            It reduced audit time from minutes to seconds. This project evolved into the{' '}

            marketers worldwide.
